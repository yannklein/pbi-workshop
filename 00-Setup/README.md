# Setup

During this week, we will use the following tools:

- **Anaconda**, a Python distribution including the **Spyder** text editor and **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Google Chrome** to search the [Python doc](https://docs.python.org/3/), Google and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tour)
- A GitHub account. If you have one, use it, if you don't, [create one](https://github.com/join) (it's free).
- **GitHub Desktop**, a tool to collaborate and archive code

If you are working on a Le Wagon-issued laptop, these tools should _already_ be installed (:warning: Don't skip the "Getting ready for the challenges" section though!).

If you are working on your own company-issued laptop, then you need to manually install the tools.

## Setup

### Anaconda

Head over to [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and **download** the latest release for **Python 3.7+**. The website should _automatically_ detect your Operating System (Windows, Mac or Linux). By default you will download the _Graphical Installer_ which is the easiest one.

Once the download is finished, **launch the installer** and go through the wizard. When all is done, check that it's working by launching the **Anaconda Navigator**. It should look like this:

### GitHub Desktop

Head over to [`desktop.github.com`](https://desktop.github.com/) to download it.

If you don't already have one, [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

Launch **GitHub Desktop**, and log in with your GitHub account. This is what you should see:

It GitHub Desktop was already installed on your computer, check that your informations are the ones present in *File* -> *Options...* -> *Git*.

## Getting ready for the challenges

Let's [**clone**](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) the exercise repository to your computer. The easiest way of doing that (i.e. avoiding the command line) is to use **GitHub Desktop**. Launch it, log in, and clone the `<user.github_nickname>/python-beginners` repository.

Make sure you know **where** the clone happened, meaning you can find the folder on your computer. We will need that later on when it comes to open an exercise boilerplate and solve the challenge. By default, GitHub Desktop on Windows will clone the repository in the following folder:
- On Windows: `C:\Users\$YOUR_USERNAME\Documents\GitHub\python-beginners`
- On macOS: `~/Documents\GitHub\python-beginners`

To make sure, select `Repository` in the menu bar and then `Show in Finder`. This action will open the folder where the repository was cloned in a Finder window.

Not sure? Ask your IT services or a TA on prep work day!

Ready? :point_right: Let's start the first exercise, **Hello World**.
