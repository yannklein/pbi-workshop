# CSV + API (Optional)

Congratulations for reaching this challenge! This one will be way less guided than the previous ones.

We are going to perform a data sourcing operation combining two datasources:

- The [`Goodread-books`](https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks) dataset on Kaggle
- The [`Open Library API`](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books)

## Goal

Create a Jupyter Notebook, and write code to load a pandas `DataFrame` with the following columns:

- Title
- Authors (delimited with `-`)
- ISBN13
- Language
- Number of Pages
- Publishers (delimited with `-`)
- Cover URL
- URL on OpenLibrary

Some of those columns will come from the CSV, some from the API.

Have fun!
