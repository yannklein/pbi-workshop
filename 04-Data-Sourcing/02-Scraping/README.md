# Scraping

In this second exercise, we will put in practise the Scraping techniques covered in this morning's lecture. The goal will be to automatically extract information from a website content with Python.

The website we are scrapping is [books.toscrape.com](http://books.toscrape.com/). It's a website which has been created exactly for that purpose! To learn how to scrape.

The goal will be to automatically retrieve information about books sold, like their name, price, their rating etc. The trick is that the website is **paginated**. Can you see how? Do you foresee it being a difficulty?

## Setup

The goal is to scrape **and** then use `pandas` to visualize the extracted information. For this exercise, it still makes sense to work in a Notebook.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Go ahead and create a new Python Notebook in the `04-Data-Sourcing/02-Scraping` folder of your `python-challenges` repository.

Start your notebook with the following imports in the first code cell:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib
```

## First request

Insert a new cell and work on the `TODO`s (the starter code is the same as the one in the lecture slides!

```python
url = "http://books.toscrape.com/"

# TODO: Use `requests` to do an HTTP request to fetch data located at that URL
# TODO: Create a `BeautifulSoup` instance with that data
```

</summary>

This code is quite generic and should be the same as the lecture! If you already have a scraping project, what you usually do is open it and copy-paste those first lines!

```python
url = "http://books.toscrape.com/"

# This is where we do an HTTP request to get the HTML from the website
response = requests.get(url)

# And this is where we feed that HTML to the Parser
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
```

</details>

`soup` is now a variable containing the parser on which we can run our queries. For that, you need to analyze the "Books to Scrape"'s website HTML with the browser inspector.

Can you spot which HTML contains **one** book? Is it identical for each book?

<details><summary markdown='span'>View solution
</summary>

The `<article />` element with the class `product_pod` is what we are looking for! All the books on the page have exactly the same structure, that's _exactly_ what we need for parsing.

```html
<article class="product_pod">
  <!-- [...] -->
</article>
```

</details>

Now that we have identified the relevant HTML, we can use the `soup` Python variable to query the document. Let's use the [searching by CSS class](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#searching-by-css-class) approach. Insert a new cell and try to select **all** books in the HTML. Store this in a `books_html` variable.

<details><summary markdown='span'>View solution
</summary>

```python
books_html = soup.find_all("article", class_="product_pod")
len(books_html)
```

</details>

Now that we have a `books_html` variable containing all the HTML `<article />`, let's focus on **one** book (the first!) and try to extract all the information we need from that HTML fragment.

## Parsing _one_ book

It's a good time for you to insert a **Markdown cell** and type in the following:

```markdown
## Parsing _one_ book
```

Of course you can write more text! We are just helping you to put more structure in your Notebook.

Let's have a look at the HTML fragment of the first book. Insert a code cell and type in:

```python
books_html[0]
```

Great! We now have a tinier piece of HTML to deal with. We can **chain** the [`.find()`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#find) on this HTML fragment to **extract** 3 pieces of information from it.

Let's start with the book *title*. Try to retrieve this information on `books_html[0]` and store it in a `book_title` variable.

<details><summary markdown='span'>View solution
</summary>

The title is located in an HTML link `<a />` inside the `<h3 />` tag. So we need to first `.find()` the `h3`, then the `a`:

```python
books_html[0].find("h3").find("a")
```

That's almost it. Now we need to select the title in the `<a />` **attributes**:

```python
books_html[0].find("h3").find("a").attrs
```

The line above returns a `dict`. You can now select the right key!

```python
book_title = books_html[0].find("h3").find("a").attrs["title"]
book_title
```

</details>

Awesome! Let's now try to retrieve the **price** of that book. Going back to the element inspection in the browser we find that the price is located within a `<p class="price_color"></p>`. Try to put the price in a `book_price` variable, and be careful, we want to get a `float`!


<details><summary markdown='span'>View solution
</summary>

Like for the `<article />` before to select books, we are going to use the "Searching by CSS class" approach, combined with using the [`.string`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#string) method:

```python
books_html[0].find("p", class_="price_color").string
```

The thing is that you want to extract the **number** (here that would be a Python `float`) rather than just text. We get rid of the first character `£` with the slice selector on the `list` and then passes all to `float()`:

```python
book_price = float(books_html[0].find("p", class_="price_color").string[1:])
book_price
```

</details>

Finally we need to get the **rating** (how many yellow stars there are for the book). Back to the browser inspector, we find that there is a `<p class="star-rating TEXT"></p>` where `TEXT` can take the values `"One"`, `"Two"`, `"Three"`, `"Four"` or `"Five"`. This one is a bit more difficult then, but doable. Insert a cell and copy/paste the following code:

```python
book_stars_html = books_html[0].find("p", class_="star-rating")
book_stars_html
```

```python
book_stars_html.attrs['class']
```

In Python, you can use the `in` keyword to check if an element is contained in a `list`. For instance:

```python
cities = [ 'paris', 'london', 'brussels' ]

if 'berlin' in cities:
    print("Berlin is available")
else:
    print("Sorry, berlin is not available")
```

:question: Define a method `parse_rating` which takes a list of classes (from the `<p />`) and return the rating from `1` to `5`:

```python
def parse_rating(rating_classes):
    # TODO: Look at `rating_classes` and return the right rating
    # e.g. of an argument for `rating_classes`: [ 'star-rating', 'Three' ]
    # "One" => 1
    # "Two" => 2
    # "Three" => 3
    # "Four" => 4
    # "Five" => 5
    return 0
```

<details><summary markdown='span'>View solution
</summary>

```python
def parse_rating(rating_classes):
    if 'One' in rating_classes:
        return 1
    elif 'Two' in rating_classes:
        return 2
    elif 'Three' in rating_classes:
        return 3
    elif 'Four' in rating_classes:
        return 4
    elif 'Five' in rating_classes:
        return 5
    else:
        return 0
```

</details>

Once you have this method, you can use it to read the book's rating! Insert a new code cell and copy/paste the following code:

```python
book_rating = parse_rating(books_html[0].find("p", class_="star-rating").attrs['class'])
```

## Parsing _all_ books

Once again, it's a good time to insert a **Markdown cell** and type in the following:

```markdown
## Parsing _all_ books
```

We now need to _glue_ all the code above and put it inside a `for` loop over the `books_html` variable! This variable is given by `soup` in return of the `.find_all` function call.

We are going to store the information collected about the books in a **Python `dict`**. This dictionary will have three keys. The **values** stored in that dictionary would be `lists` to which we append whatever we find in the HTML:

- `Title` => `["A light in the attic", "Tipping the Velvet", ...]`
- `Price` => `[51.77, 53.74, ...]`
- `Rating` => `[3, 1, ...]`

We store the information that way because we aim on giving that to Pandas, and it happens that giving the data in that format allow us to creates a Dataframe from it very easily.

Insert a new cell and initialize this dictionary

```python
books_dict = { 'Title': [], 'Price': [], 'Rating': [] }
```

:question: Write a loop over `books_html` to populate the `books_dict` dictionary reusing all the code from above.

<details><summary markdown='span'>View solution
</summary>

In a new cell, we write the `for` loop and copy paste the code

```python
for book in books_html:
    title = book.find("h3").find("a").attrs["title"]
    price = float(book.find("p", class_="price_color").text[1:])
    rating = parse_rating(book.find("p", class_="star-rating").attrs['class'])
    books_dict["Title"].append(title)
    books_dict["Price"].append(price)
    books_dict["Rating"].append(rating)
```

</details>

Have a look at the results with the following cells:

```python
books_dict
```

```python
len(books_dict)         # You should have 3 dictionaries
len(books_dict["Title"]) # Each containing 20 elements from the 20 books, as many as on the web page!
```

## Loading data in Pandas

New section! Don't forget about the **Markdown cell** to document your process as you go.

The `books_dict` looks good, let's now load that data into Pandas with the [`pandas.DataFrame.from_dict`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.from_dict.html) function:

```python
books_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(books_dict)
books_df
```

Looks great! Let's do a small plot to celebrate, let's show how many books there are per possible **Rating**:

```python
books_df.groupby("Rating").count()["Title"].plot(kind="bar")
```

Quite a lot of books with a very poor rating (1). Is it only the first page? What about the **other** pages? Time to look at page 2 and beyond!

## Going through _all_ the pages of the catalogue

New section! Don't forget about the **Markdown cell**.

On [books.toscrape.com](http://books.toscrape.com/), scroll down to the bottom and click on the "Next" button. Do it again. Do you see the **pattern** of the URL?

<details><summary markdown='span'>View solution
</summary>

```python
page = 1
url = f"http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/page-{page}.html"
url
```

</details>

We need another `for` loop! Basically a loop which will iterate from page `1` to `50` and do the scraping. While we are testing, let's just focus on scraping from page 1 to 3:

```python
MAX_PAGE = 3
for page in range(1, MAX_PAGE + 1):
    url = f"http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/page-{page}.html"
    print(url)
```

Loop's working! Let's replace the `print` with the actual code to scrape. Then run another `for` loop to scrape **all** books from the **current** page. All the code is already on your notebook, above. Time to pick it up and glue it together!


<details><summary markdown='span'>View solution
</summary>

```python
all_books_dict = { 'Title': [], 'Price': [], 'Rating': [] }

MAX_PAGE = 30
for page in range(1, MAX_PAGE + 1):
    print(f"Parsing page {page}...")
    url = f"http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/page-{page}.html"
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")

    for book in soup.find_all("article", class_="product_pod"):
        title = book.find("h3").find("a").attrs["title"]
        price = float(book.find("p", class_="price_color").text[1:])
        rating = parse_rating(book.find("p", class_="star-rating").attrs["class"])
        all_books_dict["Title"].append(title)
        all_books_dict["Price"].append(price)
        all_books_dict["Rating"].append(rating)

print("Done!")
```

</details>

All good? Check that you actually parsed `MAX_PAGE` * 20 books with:

```python
len(all_books_dict["Title"])
```

Time to load that `all_books_dict` into a Pandas `DataFrame`:

```python
all_books_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(all_books_dict)
all_books_df.tail()
```

Let's see how much the books are:

```python
all_books_df["Price"].hist()
```

And how well rated they are:

```python
all_books_df.groupby("Rating").count()["Title"].plot(kind="bar")
```

## Saving the data for later

Right now, all the scraped data is living **in memory** of the Notebook, and will be lost as soon as will `Ctrl` + `C` it. It would be a shame, so a good practise is to actually save to a file the results of a successful scraping session.

For that we will use one of the [**writers**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html) Pandas provide. We can write a `DataFrame` to disk like this:

```python
all_books_df.to_csv("books.csv")
```

If you'd rather have a regular Excel file, it's possible!

```python
all_books_df.to_excel('books.xlsx', sheet_name='Books')
```

A good practice is to create a **Data Pipeline** where one process will scrape and dump the Data to CSV, and another one will read back the data from the CSV file and go on to analyze it through a Pandas Dataframe!
