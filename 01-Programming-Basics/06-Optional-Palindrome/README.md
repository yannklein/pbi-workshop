# (Optional) Palindrome Detection

A [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. This includes capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers.

## Examples

```
"anna"   ==> true
"walter" ==> false
"Rats live on no evil star" => true
```

## Exercise

In Spyder, open the `palindrome.py` file.

Write a `is_palindrome()` function which takes one parameter:

- `sentence` (string): a word or a sequence of words to test

This function should return `True` if the `sentence` is a palindrome, regardless of spaces and case. This exercise **uses TDD**, don't forget to run the tests in Spyder!
