# Experimenting

The previous exercise was purposefully **very guided**. It's a good way to learn how to use Pandas by following simple steps and getting used to the functions available in this very vast library.

For this second exercise, we'd like you to pick up a dataset of your choice on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and download them to your hard drive. You can also pick up personal or professional datasets you want to explore.

Then navigate to the right folder in the Anaconda Prompt:

```bash
cd
cd Documents/GitHub/python-beginners/03-Data-Analysis/03-Experimenting
jupyter notebook
```

Create a new notebook (we don't provide an empty file), load the CSV and start exploring your dataset following the same course of actions that you've been shown in the first exercise.

Don't hesitate to ask some help to TAs, they will try their best to help you on your specific dataset! Remember, there's no "good answer", only questions worth **exploring the data**!

:bulb: Don't forget to **push your code to GitHub**
